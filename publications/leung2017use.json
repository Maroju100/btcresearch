    "abstract": "Bitcoin, a cryptographic currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, has been increasingly embraced by consumers as an online payment method since its introduction. Though an increasing number of tourism enterprises start offering Bitcoin as a payment option, Bitcoin has not yet been subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny. This exploratory study purports to investigate the Bitcoin usage experience in and Bitcoin usage intention for shopping travel product online by European travellers. Drawing on the responses provided by 138 European travellers, the results exhibit that the penetration of Bitcoin usage in online travel purchase among European travellers is tentatively not prominent. Respondents however reported that they will purchase some travel products and particularly restaurant and food delivery online using Bitcoin in the future. The findings are helpful for tourism and hospitality operators by informing their decision making of whether an investment should be made in order to accept Bitcoin as a payment option."
