    "abstract": "Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, promise to facilitate transactions on a decentralized computing platform among parties that have not established trust. Recognition of the unique challenges of blockchain programming has inspired developers to create domain-specific languages, such as Solidity, for programming blockchain systems. Unfortunately, bugs in Solidity programs have recently been exploited to steal money. We propose a new programming language, Obsidian, to make it easier for programmers to write correct programs."
