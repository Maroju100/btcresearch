    "abstract": "To encourage public discourse on blockchain use case development, this paper provides a pragmatic view on how to develop and to describe blockchain use cases. We approach the issue by developing a tentative use case for autonomous machine-to-machine transactions of electricity in a housing society environment through an iterative process with stakeholders in the energy industry. We proceed by evaluating the outlined concept and its technical specifications against six criteria for a sensible blockchain use case, as identified by blockchain industry specialists. Finally, we conclude with observations and discussion on the use case development process, and its future steps.",
