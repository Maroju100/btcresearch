    "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology for sharing transactional data and computation without using a central trusted third party. It is an architectural choice to use a blockchain instead of traditional databases or protocols, and this creates trade-offs between non-functional requirements such as performance, cost, and security. However, little is known about predicting the behaviour of blockchain-based systems. This paper shows the feasibility of using architectural performance modelling and simulation tools to predict the latency of blockchain-based systems. We use established tools and techniques, but explore new blockchain-specific issues such as the configuration of the number of confirmation blocks and inter-block times. We report on a labbased experimental study using an incident management system, showing predictions of median system level response time with a relative error mostly under 10%. We discuss how the approach can be used to support architectural decision-making, during the design of blockchain-based systems."
