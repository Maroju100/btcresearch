    "abstract": "In this work we re-adapt the Bitcoin e-payment system and propose it as a decentralised end-to-end voting platform (from voters to candidates). We describe the main architectural choices behind the implementation, which consists of the pre-voting, voting, and post-voting phases. The resulting implementation is completely decentralised: it is possible to directly cast a vote in the block-chain without any collecting intermediate-level. All the votes can be verified by anyone reading such a public ledger. We also exploit digital asset coins to directly keep track of votes (through the Open Asset Protocol), and we show the election cost for n voters."
