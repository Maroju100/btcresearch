    "abstract": "The panel focuses on blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. The topic has drawn much attention recently in both business and academic circles. The blockchain is a distributed, immutable digital record system that is shared among many independent parties and can be updated only by their consensus. If unbiased and incorruptible blockchain-based information systems become prevalent repositories of our records, trusting other humans with constructing and maintaining key records to define the resources at our disposal could become unnecessary. In principle, blockchain could provide a decentralized information infrastructure that no one fully controls, thereby no one has absolute power and no one can distort past or current records. The full potential let alone implications of blockchain is still unknown. The panel explores blockchain challenges and opportunities from the IS research perspective. "
