    "abstract": "AsicBoost is a method to speed up Bitcoin mining by a factor of approximately 20%. The performance gain is achieved through a highÂ­level optimization of the Bitcoin mining algorithm which allows for drastic reduction in gate count on the mining chip. AsicBoost is applicable to all types of mining hardware and chip designs. This paper presents the idea behind the method and describes the information flow in implementations of AsicBoost."
