    "abstract": "This paper presents an exploratory study focusing on user experience with Bitcoin technology. We describe interviews with 9 Bitcoin users and report findings related to users’ motivations for buying and using bitcoins. Our initial findings capture three main motivations such as Bitcoin’s predicted role in a monetary revolution, users’ increased empowerment, and their perception of a real value of Bitcoin currency. We conclude with reflections on the value of these findings for HCI researchers. "
