In the first part a thorough explanation of the technology and the problems it is trying to tackle is attempted. At the same time a background on Bitcoin (the first application of the technology) is provided. In the second part it is examined whether the technology could be leveraged to solve problems in different fields, while some specific recommendations for the Greek economy are also made.",
