    "abstract": "With the development of Economic Globalization, traditional single-cloud providers can not meet the needs of the explosive, global, diverse cloud services. JointCloud aims at empowering the cooperation among multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSP) to provide cross-cloud services. Our work in this paper is mainly focused on the accounting technology for JointCloud computing and we propose the JCLedger â€” a blockchain based distributed ledger. A new participant CCP (Cryptocurrency Provider) is introduced into the JointCloud collaboration environment to provide the cryptocurrency transferred. We have a detailed description of JCLedger model. We further analyze the four most important mechanisms for JCLedger and provide basic perspectives for in-depth analysis. Finally, we discuss the innovations of JCLedger and our future work in this field."
