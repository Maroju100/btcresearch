    "abstract": "A proposal for Universal Basic Income to be implemented on a global scale via the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and DNA genome scanning identification, funded by a 1% increase in the existing transaction fee. This proposal creates incentive to attract new members to the use of Bitcoin, to offer commerce for Bitcoin, to manage the creation and upkeep of unique accounts and to maintain a database of open-sourced DNA genomes in the blockchain online for medical research and anonymous ailment identification. After an initial implementation creates high incentive for increased membership and cheaper DNA scanners, the daily dividend would settle to $1 - $6 per day for all adults, children and infants signing up for the free benefits. As daily transaction volume increases due to increased commerce among this group, this dividend would increase and attract further growth. Should the dividend prove insufficient, membership growth will slow, allowing per capita dividend to rise. Bitcoin volatility would be reduced and the most productive forms of commerce would be attracted. Many more cultural, social and environmental benefits would result beyond any comparable basic income proposal."
