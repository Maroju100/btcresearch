This article seeks to assess the issue of Bitcoin price formation from a novel perspective. We use a new technique called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with which a complicated data set can be disentangled into a small number of independent and concretely implicational intrinsic modes that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. Even though Bitcoin is usually labelled as a purely speculative asset, EMD views that it is extremely driven by long-term fundamentals (above one year).",
