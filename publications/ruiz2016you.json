    "abstract": "In recent years there has been an increase in money laundering due, in part, to new digital resources like the bitcoin. The bitcoin is a decentralized electronic coin created in 2008. It is considered the most used method on line to launder money. This is because there is not a central server doing the transactions per-to-peer, and these are anonymous. It is important to note that the issue of bitcoins is limited to 21.000.000 units. Some of the ways used to money laundry are the mixers, Deep Web, and others. Finally to indicate that money laundry has different phases such as the placing, stratification, and investment, before getting into the financial system illegally. Unfortunately, the current legislation is poor in this matter. Although, we can find the following legislation, in article 301CP, the 2006/112/CI Directive of the Counsel, plus one of the LPBC. Even though the legislation is scant, there are some bodies working on the prevention of money laundering, like FATF and SEPBLAC.",
