    "abstract": "Bitcoin is a crypto currency with several advantages over previous approaches. Transactions are confirmed and stored by a peer-to-peer network in a blockchain. Therefore, all transactions are public and soon solutions where designed to increase privacy in Bitcoin Many come with downsides, like requiring a trusted third-party or requiring modi®cations to Bitcoin. In this paper, we compare these approaches according to several criteria. Based on our ®ndings, CoinJoin emerges as the best approach for anonymizing Bitcoins today."
