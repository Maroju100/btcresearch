    "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that can be utilized to break ground for secure provenance through the use of a centralized-based application. The method of distributed ledger can serve as the trust machine mechanism to prevent the malicious attacks. This paper introduces a novel service to complement some open-source blockchain protocols. A vital point of adopting blockchain technology is to encourage more and more parties to join for higher security and better efficiency. National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) has initiated a service, named NBCP, for rapidly constructing multiple blockchain nodes around Taiwan. With several pros, users can easily construct private blockchain nodes, catering to the need of developing various prototypes of blockchain-based applications."
