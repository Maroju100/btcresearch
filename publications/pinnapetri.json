    "abstract": "The most Bitcoin users are very careful about keeping their anonymity. In this work we investigate the use of disposable addresses, a very common method adopted by users to protect their identity and propose a method to recognize these addresses, We applied it on the first 180,000 blocks of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Results highlighted that a large part of Bitcoin transactions involves disposable addresses. Further, they showed that many of these transactions form chains whose length is characterized by a power-law distribution."
