    "abstract": "With the increase in the use of virtual currencies across the globe, the security of Bitcoin wallets has become a serious concern for the Bitcoin community. The developers are trying to implement concrete security solutions in Bitcoin wallets to ensure that no vulnerability gets exploited. However, a large number of known, as well as zero-day attacks, are launched on the Bitcoin wallets on a daily basis, resulting in a loss of bitcoins. In this regard, this paper presents a security analysis of existing Android wallets. We demonstrate how the implemented security practices can be bypassed by malicious entities, causing financial loss to Bitcoin users. As a countermeasure, we present a smart card based authentication scheme which will protect the users from all of the identified attacks."
