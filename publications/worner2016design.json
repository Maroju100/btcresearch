    "abstract": "An ever increasing number of physical and virtual sensors are digitizing the world around us. Today, most of this data is trapped in application-specific environments, and even if accessible in principle, discovery remains a problem. An open and transparent data market brings incentives for sensor owners to offer measurement data and provides means for discovery. We envision a decentralized data market based on peer-to-peer data exchange and payments. The presented prototype is an iteration of this idea based on the 21 Bitcoin computer, a computer with an embedded Bitcoin mining chip, as well as tools and services to simplify machine-to-machine payments based on Bitcoin.",
