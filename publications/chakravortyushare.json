    "abstract": "This paper presents the potential for blockchain based solutions to disrupt the world of social networking. We offer Ushare, a user centric blockchain supported social media network that enables users to control, trace and claim ownership of every piece of content they share. Harnessing peer-topeer capabilities of the blockchain technology allows a truly decentralized, secure, anonymous and traceable content distribution network. Ushare consists of four key components: the blockchain, a hash table with encrypted content shared by a user, a Turing complete relationship system to control the the maximum number of shares performed by user’s circle members and a local personal certificate authority that manages the user’s circles and encrypts data to be shared before it is broadcasted to the network."
