    "abstract": "In this whitepaper we propose a system that enables secure descent of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain based assets with involvement of an untrusted third party. A multisignature authentication principle in cooperation with two third party services, that A) identify the date of oneâ€™s demise and B) store a part of the multisignature authentification, are the core of the system. It is thus a novel approach towards blockchain based testaments."
