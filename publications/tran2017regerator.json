    "abstract": "A registry is a list of information recorded by a trusted authority. Registries have security requirements for data integrity and availability, and for the ability to connect with other registries. Building registries on a blockchain leverages key properties of blockchains, including data integrity, immutability, and availability. By using a blockchain as uniform infrastructure, different registries can also more easily interact with each other. In this paper, we present a browser-based tool for the model-driven generation and deployment of registries as smart contracts on blockchain. The tool also generates web-based RESTful APIs and user interfaces to interact with the generated registries. We evaluate the feasibility and transaction costs for this approach using metadata from data.gov.au, stored on a decentralised derivative of CKAN (a web-based open-source data registration system) built on the Ethereum blockchain"
