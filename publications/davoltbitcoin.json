In an effort to analyze Bitcoin, we must discuss what money is at its core, its role in the economy, and its importance in society. The launch of Bitcoin, its potential pros and cons and how it could impact our current system will all be discussed. The importance of the science behind Bitcoin, the blockchain, and how this could be implemented is examined. Questions are posed and ideas are offered about how this technology may impact our current economic system",
