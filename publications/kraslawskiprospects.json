    "abstract": "Currency can be defined as the generally accepted form of money that is the basis for trade. Currencies are usually issued by the governments of countries where they are originated, but there are also branded and digital currencies, the types that are not tied to any country. (Investopedia 2016a) The branded currencies, such as credit card points, are valued in their relation to the product or a service they are tied to, where digital, such as the most impactful one - Bitcoin, are difficult to understand without fully comprehending of traditional currency paradigm and its development."
