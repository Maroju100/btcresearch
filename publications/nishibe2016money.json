    "abstract": "We have seen that anything could be money, that a wrong understanding of markets has been widespread because mainstream economics has neglected money, and that money is not a convenient tool for the market, but rather that money creates markets (in the beginning was the money). We have examined the various characteristics of money, but have almost never talked about the money we actually use today. Now, by focusing on our current money from the ten thousand yen bill issued by the Bank of Japan to Bitcoin, we will approach the enigma of money.",
