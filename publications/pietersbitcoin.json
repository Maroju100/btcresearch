    "abstract": "Managed exchange rates and capital controls impact international trade and finance flows, yet data used to detect these manipulations are of low frequency, expensive, lagged, and potentially mis-measured. The timely, high frequency, free-of-charge prices of Bitcoin offer a solution to this problem. I demonstrate that the internationally traded crypto-currency can estimate unofficial exchange rates, detect exchange rate regimes; and detect capital controls at a daily frequency. However, Bitcoin prices may contain bitcoin-specific dynamics that must be removed prior to being used for this purpose, and Bitcoin-based exchange rates approximate the dynamics, but not the level, of unofficial exchange rates."
