# CABRA &mdash; Comprehensive Academic Bitcoin Research Archive

CABRA is an attempt to collect and organize metadata about ongoing Bitcoin research.

## Why?

when researching Bitcoin and Blockchain technology it is sometimes difficult to keep up to date with the latest developments. This is my attempt to make it easier.

Looking for a comprehensive list of publications I stumbled over Brett Scott's excellent [Bitcoin Academic Research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg/) list, which contains an impressive number of Bitcoin/Blockchain related publications.
The format of a shared Google Sheet may be well suited for quick collaboration and having many people contribute to the list, however allwing everybody write access also has its downsides. I think a source repository with a controlled process for people to contribute is better suited for such an effort.

In addition storing the publications in a well documented format allows us to better annotate, search for individual publications, and generate a number of derived formats, e.g., a bibtex file for future publications.

## Contributions

This project aims to include as many academic papers as possible, but my time is limited and while I try to keep up to date with the latest publications I might miss some. If you'd like to contribute to this archive feel free to fork the repository and/or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/cdecker/btcresearch/pulls).

In order to keep the data consistent, please adhere to the [JSON-Schema](https://github.com/cdecker/btcresearch/blob/master/btcresearch-schema.json) in this repository.
